## Phase 9: Inspirations Board
### Checklist
- [PROGRESS] Implement a 2x2 grid view for recommended videos. This will be the new "homepage" after a user logs in. The 4 videos it loads can be random for now. When I press on one of the videos, it should go to that video and play it.
- [ ] Make it so that when a video is playing, I can swipe to the right and it will go back to the inspiration board (the 2x2 grid view).
