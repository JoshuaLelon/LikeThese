# User Stories
## Pause and Play:
"As a user, I want to pause and resume a playing video by tapping anywhere on it during playback."

## Video Replacement:
"As a user, I want the system to replace the video I'm watching when I swipe up."

## Autoplay:
"As a user, I want the system to populate a new video when the current one ends."

## Previously Watched:
"As a user, I want to be able to swipe down from the current video to revisit the previous video."

## Inspirations
"As a user, I want an Inspirations boardâ€”a dynamic 2x2 grid of videos that guide and refine my recommendations based on what I keep or swipe away. I want to switch between the current video and the board by either swiping right on the playing video or tapping on a video in the grid."

## Multiswipe:
"As a user, I want to replace one video at a time by swiping it up AND replace multiple videos at the same time by holding between two videos or in the center of the 2x2 grid and swiping up. I want the system to replace them with new videos based on the ones I've left on the grid."
